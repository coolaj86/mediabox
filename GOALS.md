Goals
===
  * normalization
  * prettify
  * client side md5
  * full library shuffle

  ### Thoughts on Albums
  * in the post-cd era few people have 50+ tracks of the same artist (except The Beatles, Weezer, Taylor Swift and a handful of others)
  * how is it possible to determine if a track in on a compilation?
  * should compilations be sorted as artists and albums be dropped?

  ### Thoughts on Shuffle
  * shuffle should be on by default
  * low-rated songs should not appear in shuffle
  * seasonal items should not appear in shuffle

  ### Thoughts on tagging
  * indicate when a tag is unconfirmed
  * indicate when multiple streams are available
  * allow final merge (deletion) of duplicate tags, streams, and songs
